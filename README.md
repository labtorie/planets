# Planets
Pure JS implementation of some kind of gravity simulation based on a formula I've learnt from school. 

Features:
1) Visualization of forces affecting on each planet
2) Zoom and pan
3) Different camera modes (free cam + planet tracking)
4) Poorly implemented trace rendering
5) Stars with parallax effect (proud of it)

That's the thing, basically. Demo is [here](https://labtorie.github.io/planets/)
